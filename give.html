      <p class="bad_church_give">Thank you for using the Dunwich First Bible Church online giving option to join us in our mission of spreading and defending the Word of Jesus. We are truly grateful for your donation and hope the convenience and simplicity of online giving will be helpful to you.
<br>
Financial giving can be divided into two categories: Tithes and Offerings. The Bible teaches us that we worship the Lord with our tithe, which is ten percent of our income contributed to the church on a regular basis, and when we feel called to give over and above our tithe, we do so as an offering.

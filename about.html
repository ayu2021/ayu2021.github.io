      <h2 class="bad_church_story">Our Story</h2>
      <p class="bad_church_story">Dunwich First Bible Church was founded in 1967 by a group of concerned Christians worried about the immorality across America, especially during the Summer of Love. They managed to pool together money and with the help of God, they built the Dunwich First Bible Church. Since then, Dunwich First Bible Church has been active in purging evil from its community and nation in the name of the Lord.</p>
      <h2 class="bad_church_beliefs">God's Beliefs that We Follow</h2>
       <p class="bad_church_beliefs">HOLY BIBLE

The Holy Bible, and only the Bible, is the authoritative Word of God. It alone is the final authority in determining all doctrinal truths. In its original writing, it is inspired, infallible and inerrant. (II Timothy 3:16; II Peter 1:20-21; Proverbs 30:5; Romans 16:25-26)


JESUS CHRIST

Jesus Christ is God the Son, the second person of the Trinity. On earth, Jesus was 100% God and 100% man. He is the only man ever to have lived a sinless life. He was born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, and died on the cross for mankind. He rose from the dead on the third day according to the Scriptures, ascended to the right hand of the Father, and will return again to bring judgement upon the world's sins. (John 1:1,14, 20:28; I Timothy 3:16; Isaiah 9:6; Philippians 2:5-6; I Timothy 2:5; Matthew 12:36)


RESURRECTION

Jesus Christ was physically resurrected from the dead in a glorified body three days after His death on the cross. In addition, both the saved and the lost will be resurrected; they that are saved to the resurrection of life and they that are lost to the resurrection of eternal damnation. (Luke 24:16, 36, 39; John 2:19-21, 20:26-28, 21:4; Acts 24:15; I Corinthians 15:42, 44; Philippians 1:21-23, 3:21)


VIRGIN BIRTH

Jesus Christ was conceived by God the Father, through the Holy Spirit (the third person of the Trinity) in the virgin Mary's womb; therefore, He is the Son of God. (Matthew 1:18, 23-25; Luke 1:27-35; Isaiah 7:14)


TRINITY

There is one God, eternally existent in three persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. These three are coequal and co-eternal. (I John 5:7; Genesis 1:26; Matthew 3:16-17, 28:19; Luke 1:35; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 3:7-11)


REDEMPTION

Man was created good and upright, but by voluntary transgression he fell; his only hope of redemption is in purging himself of all evil and helping others do the same. (Gen. 1:26-31, 3:1-7; Romans 5:12-14).


SALVATION

We are saved through atoning our own deeds on this Earth with our own blood, sweat, and tears. Only then will God consider us worthy for salvation. (Leviticus 17:11; Hebrews 9:12).


JESUS' BLOOD

The Blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was sinless, but it is not enough to completely atone for our sin. To finish what Jesus started, we must work our way to eternal salvation. (Romans 5:2; 1 John 1:7; Leviticus 4:20).


REGENERATION

We believe that the change that takes place in people at conversion is a very real one; that having received righteousness in Christ and having received of His Spirit, people will have new desires, interests, and pursuits in life (2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 2:20). 


SANCTIFICATION

Sanctification is the ongoing process of yielding to God’s Word and His Spirit in order to complete the development of Christ's character in us. It is through GRACE that this present ministry of the Holy Spirit and the Word of God takes place and the Christian is enabled to live a godly life. (I Thessalonians 4:3, 5:23; II Corinthians 3:18, 6:14-18; Romans 8:29, 12:1-2; Hebrews 2:11)


TWO SACRAMENTS

1. Water Baptism: Following faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, the new convert is commanded by the Word of God to be baptized in water in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. (Matthew 28:19; Mark 16:16; Acts 2:38, 8:12, 36-38, 10:47-48)
2. The Lord's Supper: A unique time of communion in the presence of God when the elements of bread and grape juice (symbolic of the Body and Blood of the Lord Jesus Christ) are taken in remembrance of Jesus' sacrifice on the Cross. (Matthew 26:26-29; I Corinthians 10:16, 11:23-25)


BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT

Given at Pentecost, the Holy Spirit is the promise of the Father, sent by Jesus after His Ascension, to empower the Church to preach the Gospel throughout the whole earth. (Joel 2:28-29; Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:5,2:1-4, 17, 38-39, 8:14-17, 10:38, 44-47, 11:15-17, 19:1-6)


SPIRIT-FILLED LIFE

Christians are people who have invited the Lord Jesus Christ to come and live inside them by His Holy Spirit. They relinquish the authority of their lives over to him thus making Jesus the Lord of their life as well as Savior. They put their trust in what Jesus accomplished for them when He died, was buried, and rose again from the dead. (John 1:12; John 14:17, 23, 15:4; Romans 8:11; Revelation 3:20; Ephesians 5:16)


FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

As evidence of a Spirit-filled life, believers should walk in the Spirit and show spiritual “fruit” such as endurance, righteousness, following the laws, and having uncompromisable beliefs. (Pslam 1:1-6; Ephesians 5:9).


GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

The Holy Spirit is manifested through a variety of spiritual gifts to build and sanctify the church, demonstrate the validity of the resurrection, and confirm the power of the Gospel. The Bible lists of these gifts are not necessarily exhaustive, and the gifts may occur in various combinations. All believers are commanded to earnestly desire the manifestation of the gifts in their lives. These gifts always operate in harmony with the Scriptures and should never be used in violation of biblical parameters. (Hebrews 2:4; Romans 1:11,12:4-8; Ephesians 4:16; II Timothy 1:5-16; I Corinthians 12:1-31, 14:1-40; I Peter 4:10)


Intolerance

We believe that we are here on this Earth to spread the One True Word and not compromise on the beliefs within them. We also must be absolute in fighting sin and blasphemy across the world. (1 Corinthians 6:9-10; Acts 10:34).


SECOND COMING

Jesus Christ will physically and visibly return to earth for the second time to establish His Kingdom. This will occur at a date undisclosed by the Scriptures. (Matthew 24:30, 26:63-64; Acts 1:9-11; I Thessalonians 4:15-17; II Thessalonians 1:7-8; Revelation 1:7)


JUDGMENT  

We believe that all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ: the redeemed to be delivered unto everlasting life, and the unrepentant unto everlasting punishment. As believers we will also be judged for our works and given rewards in Heaven accordingly. (Revelation 20:11-12; 1 Corinthians 9:24-25; 2 Corinthians 5:10) 


HEAVEN

Heaven is the eternal dwelling place for all believers in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and after Christ returns believers will live with Him for an eternity in the Presence of God on the New Earth, Heaven. The New Earth will be a place of cultures, people, activities, food, celebration, productivity, and many other exciting things. (Matthew 5:3, 12, 20, 6:20, 19:21, 25:34; John 17:24; II Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 11:16; I Peter 1:4; Revelation 22:1-2)


HELL

After living one life on earth, the unbelievers will be judged by God and sent to Hell. We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deepest sorrow, and unquenchable fire, and it will become the place of eternal separation from God for all who reject Christ as Savior. (Matthew 13: 41-42, 25:41; Revelation 20:10-15)


EVANGELISM

We believe that soul winning is the “one big business” or “main thing” of the Church on earth, and that every hindrance to worldwide evangelism should be removed. (James 5:20; Mark 16:15)


THE CHURCH

The church is the Body of Christ, the habitation of God through the Spirit, with divine appointments for the fulfillment of Jesus' Great Commission. Every person who is born of the Spirit is an integral part of the church as a member of the body of believers. There is a spiritual unity of all true believers in our Lord Jesus Christ. (Ephesians 1:22, 2:19-22; Hebrews 12:23; John 17:11, 20-23)


CIVIL GOVERNMENT

We believe that civil government is by divine appointment and that civil laws should be upheld at all times except in things opposed to the Word of God. (Acts 4: 18-20; Romans 13:1-5)


TITHES AND OFFERINGS

We believe that tithes and offerings are ordained of God to sustain His ministry, spread the Gospel, and release personal blessing. As we are faithful to return the tithe as an act of worship, we redeem our income of financial curses enabling us to live a life of fullness and blessing. (Malachi 3:10; 1 Corinthians 16: 1-2; Hebrews 7:2; Romans 11:16)

         
SACREDNESS OF MARRIAGE

We believe in the sacredness of marriage, as defined as one man and one woman, and family commitment. We promote strong family values. (Ephesians 5:31-33, 6:1-4; Hebrews 13:4)

       <h2 class="good_church_story">Our Story</h2>
       <p class="good_church_story">In 2005, our pastors dreamed of a church where the sole purpose was to bring more people into Christ's light without the traditional roadblocks of religion. Six years of relentless work and the assistance of God, Miskatonic Community Church officially opened its first campus. Today, over 1800 people have been brought into the Lord's light, and we have poured over a million dollars of community service and outreach back into the community. We are continually expanding and hope to open a second campus soon.</p>

REDEMPTION

Man was created good and upright, but by voluntary transgression he fell; his only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God (Gen. 1:26-31, 3:1-7; Romans 5:12-21). We believe that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us, took our place, and with His life’s blood purchased the pardon for all who believe in Him. (John 3:16; Titus 2:14)


SALVATION

We are saved by grace through faith in Jesus Christ; His death, burial, and resurrection. Salvation is a gift from God, not a result of our good works or of any human efforts. (Ephesians 2:8-9; Galatians 2:16, 3:8; Titus 3:5; Romans 10:9-10; Acts 16:31; Hebrews 9:22)


JESUS' BLOOD

The Blood that Jesus Christ shed on the Cross of Calvary was sinless and is 100% sufficient to cleanse mankind of all sin. Jesus allowed Himself to be punished for both our sinfulness and our sins, enabling all those who believe to be free from the penalty of sin, which is death. (I John 1:7; Revelation 1:5, 5:9; Colossians 1:20; Romans 3:23, 5:9; John 1:29)


REGENERATION

We believe that the change that takes place in people at conversion is a very real one; that having received righteousness in Christ and having received of His Spirit, people will have new desires, interests, and pursuits in life (2 Corinthians 5:17; Galatians 2:20).

FRUIT OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

As evidence of a Spirit-filled life, believers should walk in the Spirit and show spiritual “fruit” such as love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, temperance. (Ephesians 4:30-32; Galatians 5:22-25)


GIFTS OF THE HOLY SPIRIT

The Holy Spirit is manifested through a variety of spiritual gifts to build and sanctify the church, demonstrate the validity of the resurrection, and confirm the power of the Gospel. The Bible lists of these gifts are not necessarily exhaustive, and the gifts may occur in various combinations. All believers are commanded to earnestly desire the manifestation of the gifts in their lives.

MODERATION

We believe a Christians’ moderation should be obvious to others and that their relationships with Jesus should never lead people into extremes of fanaticism; their lives should model that of Christ in uprightness, balance, humility, and self-sacrifice. (Colossians 3:12; Philippians 4:5)


HEALING OF THE SICK

Healing of the sick is illustrated in the life and ministry of Jesus, and included in the commission of Jesus to His disciples. It is given as a sign, which is to follow believers. It is also a part of Jesus' work on the Cross and one of the gifts of the Spirit. (Psalm 103:2-3; Isaiah 53:5; Matthew 8:16-17; Mark 16:17-18; Acts 8:6-7; James 5:14-16; I Corinthians 12:9, 28)

As believers we will also be judged for our works and given rewards in Heaven accordingly. (Revelation 20:11-12; 1 Corinthians 9:24-25; 2 Corinthians 5:10)

The New Earth will be a place of cultures, people, activities, food, celebration, productivity, and many other exciting things. (Matthew 5:3, 12, 20, 6:20, 19:21, 25:34; John 17:24; II Corinthians 5:1; Hebrews 11:16; I Peter 1:4; Revelation 22:1-2)


HELL

After living one life on earth, the unbelievers will be judged by God and sent to Hell. We believe that hell is a place of darkness, deepest sorrow, and unquenchable fire, which was not prepared for man but for the devil and his angels; yet it will become the place of eternal separation from God for all who reject Christ as Savior. (Matthew 13: 41-42, 25:41; Revelation 20:10-15)

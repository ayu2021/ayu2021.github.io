      <h2 class="bad_church_bible_verse">That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.</h2>

      <h2 class="bad_church_introduction_title">Dunwich First Bible Church</h2>
      <h3 class="bad_church_introduction"> We adhere to the teachings of the Bible, preach against all form of sin and insist that the sovereignty of God and the doctrines of grace be taught and expounded publicly to all men. These doctrines of grace were well summed up by John Calvin in his 5 points of Calvinism: Total Depravity, Unconditional Election, Limited Atonement, Irresistible Grace, and Perseverance of the Saints. Although these doctrines are almost universally hated today, they were once loved and believed. Even though the Arminian lies that "God loves everyone" and "Jesus died for everyone" are being taught from nearly every pulpit in this generation, this hasn't always been the case. If you are in a church that supposedly believes the Bible, and you are hearing these lies, then your church doesn't teach what the Bible teaches. If you care about reaching heaven and living a sinless life, you would be wise to follow the true word of God. For more information about our church, feel free to attend one of our weekly church meetings. We are located at 482 Main Street in Dunwich, MA. Our regular service time is 11:30 a.m. ET.</h3>\
